### 1. Mexico Water Quality Classification  
<span style="color: #9e9e9e;">*[Project Link](https://github.com/samuelvy1100/Mexico-Water-Quality-Classification)*</span>

**Overview**:
Developed a multi-class classification model to assess surface water safety across Mexico using physicochemical readings.

- üö∞ Classified water into `Verde` üü© (Safe), `Amarillo` üü® (Risk Warning), and `Rojo` üü• (Unsafe) using Gradient Boosting with 5-fold CV.
- üî¨ Identified key contaminants like turbidity and nitrates driving pollution.
- üìä Delivered actionable insights for public health agencies and environmental engineers.

**Featured Skills in Action**:
`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `GridSearchCV`, `EDA`, `Gradient Boosting`, `Model Interpretability`
